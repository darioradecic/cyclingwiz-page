A couple of weeks back, I've officially started my 2023/2024 indoor cycling season. It was also my first time using the **Tacx Neo 2T smart turbo trainer** (review coming soon), and I have to say - it's miles ahead of my old Elite Suito.

This season, I want to take a different approach. Instead of riding whichever route I felt like riding that day, I want to try a **structured training program**. I stumbled upon Zwift's [6-week Beginner FTP Builder](https://whatsonzwift.com/workouts/ftp-builder), and it seems like a good fit.

I've only tested my FTP once and it was months ago on my old turbo trainer. I got a score of 254W or around 2.5 watts per kilo. Not great, to say at least.

My hope with this structured training plan is to **increase my FTP to 300W** region. It's quite ambitious, but who knows - maybe I end up surprising myself.

I'll do a final review of the 6-week training plan after completing it, but in the meantime, I'll post a weekly update so you can know what to expect if you want to try this workout plan for yourself.

**Here are the grand total stats for Week 1:**

{{< workout-stats
    title = "Week 1 statistics"
    distance = 118.70
    duration = 04:10:11
    elevation = 821
    calories = 2536
>}}

Let's dig into the impressions!

## Workout #1 - Ramp Test

{{< workout-stats
    distance = 12.5
    duration = 00:30:55
    elevation = 100
    calories = 291
>}}

Oh, boy, these are never pleasant. It doesn't help that I've done pretty much an all-out training the day before, but it is what it is.

In case you don't know, a **Ramp test** is an all-out seated FTP test. The idea is to ramp the power up by 20W every minute, which the trainer does for you automatically.

Your task is to pedal at a steady pace (85 RPM for me) until you physically can't turn the pedals.

The test started easily, but really got me sweating after the 320W mark.

I managed to last for almost 31 minutes, getting my heart rate up to **192 beats per minute**!


## Workout #2 - Foundation

{{< workout-stats
    distance = 24.1
    duration = 00:48:33
    elevation = 134
    calories = 475
>}}

This is by far the type of workout I like the least. The goal is to ride in intervals below 75% of your FTP but with a high cadence - **up to 100 RPM**.

I typically ride at 80-85 RPM, and increasing the cadence did a number on my heart rate.

As you can see, I'm above 150 BPM on a power that feels almost effortless to me:

    src = "images/2.jpeg"
    alt = "Foundation training"
>}}

I hope that high-cadence sessions will become easier on my cardiovascular system throughout the next couple of weeks.



## Workout #3 - Strength

{{< workout-stats
    distance = 26.5
    duration = 00:54:33
    elevation = 142
    calories = 510
>}}

It doesn't make sense, but this one required less effort than a Foundation workout the day before.

The idea is to ride in 2-minute intervals, in which you ride at around 53% of your FTP for 01:50 minutes, and the remaining 10 seconds are somewhat of an **all-out seated effort** - targeted around 160% of your FTP.

{{< my-image
    src = "images/3.jpeg"
    alt = "Strength training"
>}}

This workout was fun for me since the cadence was moderate the entire time, and I generally have no trouble **cranking up the wattage** for short bursts of time.



## Workout #4 - Foundation

{{< workout-stats
    distance = 24.6
    duration = 00:48:44
    elevation = 182
    calories = 494
>}}

Another high-cadence workout. Great.

There must be something **wrong** with my form or technique because riding at 100 RPM feels extra hard and unnatural at times.

{{< my-image
    src = "images/4.jpeg"
    alt = "Foundation training"
>}}

**The good part** - it was over in 48 minutes.


## Workout #5 - Tempo

{{< workout-stats
    distance = 31.0
    duration = 01:07:26
    elevation = 263
    calories = 766
>}}

Now, this is the type of workout I love. 

The goal is to spend a good amount of time riding around **88% of your FTP**, or in [Zone 3](https://support.trainerroad.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005942786-Understanding-Power-Zones), followed by recovery intervals.

{{< my-image
    src = "images/5.jpeg"
    alt = "Tempo training"
>}}

The cadence was moderate, and the whole session felt like it was focusing on my legs and muscle power, rather than my cardiovascular system.

At the end of the day - it's just **personal preference**. You might prefer high-cadence workouts, which means this one will feel like hard work.

## Week 1 Conclusion
I probably shouldn't have decided to enroll in this workout plan on Tuesday, the day after already completing a high-intensity one-hour cycling session. Or I should at least give myself a couple of days of **rest** before taking an FTP test.

But it is what it is - real-life conditions are never perfect.

Week 1 was fun, and I ended up with **6 workout sessions in 7 days**. I'm accustomed to 2-3 sessions per week, and doubling the volume wasn't easy, especially during those high-cadence intervals. 

Still, I have zero regrets and hope I'll increase my FTP by 5-10% at the end of the 6-week training plan.
