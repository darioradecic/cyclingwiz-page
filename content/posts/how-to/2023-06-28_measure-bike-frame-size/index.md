## How to Measure Bike Frame Size - The Ultimate Guide
If you're wondering how to measure a bike frame size, there's usually just one measure you should consider - **seat tube length**. It is essentially a length between the center of the bottom bracket (where your cranks are attached) to the point where the seat tube meets the top tube (images below).

In reality, things aren't always that simple. More and more bikes come with an angled top tube, so measuring bike frame size as described previously won't work. Instead, you'll have to measure something known as the **effective seat tube length**. This measure annuls the difference in seat tube length caused by the angle of your bike's top tube. In plain English, it imagines the top was straight, and on the same height as the head tube.

This article will walk you through measuring bike frame size step by step through detailed descriptions and images. After reading, you'll know exactly how to measure a bike frame size on any bike. Let's dig in!

A very traditional way of measuring a bike frame size is to measure the length of the seat tube. This is the tube connecting your bottom bracket (where the cranks are attached) with the top tube. In other words, it's a tube located below your saddle.

Start the measuring process by **positioning your bike on a level surface**, as shown below:

{{< my-image
    src = "images/1.jpg"
    alt = "Giant Revolt Advanced 1 2022 in XL (60 cm)"
>}}

From here, you'll want to measure the seat tube length, which is represented by the green line on the image:

{{< my-image
    src = "images/2.jpg"
    alt = "Seat tube length measure"
>}}

Simply take a measuring tape and measure the seat tube length. It's a good idea to measure road/gravel bike frames in centimeters, so if you're working in inches, simply multiply the result by 2.54:

{{< my-image
    src = "images/3.jpg"
    alt = "Measured seat tube length"
>}}

Our measuring tape states 53 cm (21"), which definitely isn't right for an XL-sized bike. Giant labels their bike sizes from XS to XL, instead of the more traditional centimeter size approach. 

Nevertheless, measuring a bike frame size this way is wrong. **The reason?** The bike has a sloped top tube, which means that measuring the frame size without considering that will give inaccurate results.

Let's explore how to take the top tube angle into consideration next.

Many modern road and gravel bikes have an angled top tube, which is a good design choice if you ask us. Unfortunately, it makes measuring the bike frame size a bit trickier, since an angled top tube implies a shorter seat tube.

That's where the effective seat tube length measure comes into play. To calculate it, first draw a straight line from the top of the head tube to the seat tube. The point where they intersect will mark the location from which you should start taking a measure to the bottom bracket:

{{< my-image
    src = "images/4.jpg"
    alt = "Effective seat tube length measure"
>}}

Note that capturing every aspect of this on an image is nearly impossible, but we did our best. The effective seat tube length is 60 cm or 23.6", as you can see from the following image:

{{< my-image
    src = "images/5.jpg"
    alt = "Measured effective seat tube length"
>}}

These results make much more sense considering we're dealing with an XL-sized bike. For Giant, that means 60 cm, which is spot on with our measure.




{{< section-title-green id = "top-tube" title = "Measure a Bike Frame Size Through Top Tube Length" >}}
But what can you do if even the effective seat tube length seems off? It's a genuine possibility since some bike manufacturers use different measures to determine the frame size.

One of these alternative measures is the top tube length. Essentially, it measures the entire length of your bike's top tube, starting at the head tube and ending at the seat tube. Here's an example of how can you take this measure:

{{< my-image
    src = "images/6.jpeg"
    alt = "Measured top tube length"
>}}

It also measures 60 cm, just like the effective seat tube length!

So, what is the correct way to measure a bike frame size? Let's find out next.



{{< section-title-green id = "the-correct-way" title = "What's the Correct Way to Measure Bike Frame Size? Bike Sizes Explained" >}}
Different manufacturers use different measures to represent the bike frame size. Some might go with the traditional seat tube length or effective seat tube length, while others opt for the top tube length.

**It's impossible to tell without contacting the manufacturer directly.**

We've measured a 2022 Giant Revolt Advanced 1 XL in this article, and it looks like the effective seat tube length and the top tube length measures both confirm the bike frame size. That might not be the case for you.

The best practice is to refer to the official geometry charts to see exactly what makes an XL bike an XL bike. Here are the stats for our Giant:

{{< credited-image
    src = "images/7.png"
    alt = "Giant Revolt Advanced 1 official geometry"
    page-url = "https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/revolt-advanced-1"
    page-name = "Giant"
>}}

You can see how the seat tube length matches the first measure taken today, but there's no info on effective seat tube length. Likewise, the top tube length also matches what we've measured.

## How to Measure Bike Frame Size - Summary
Long story short, measuring a bike frame size is getting harder by the day. More and more bike manufacturers do crazy things with bike geometries, and most new bikes come with an angled top tube. These factors make measuring frame sizes more challenging than only a decade ago.

**What can you do?** The best option is to go over the bike geometry values. Also, visit a local bike shop if you have the chance and try the same bike in a size smaller and larger than the one you'd typically ride. Frame size is just one measure, and maybe you'll find a slightly smaller/bigger bike more comfortable.

We hope you've enjoyed this article and learned that measuring a bike frame size isn't as simple as it seems.
