## How to Store a Bike in an Apartment - 10 Options

How to store a bike in an apartment? That's always a tricky one, especially when tight spaces are involved. A lot of things could go wrong, especially if you don't invest some time into planning the optimal strategy for how to store bikes in an apartment. 

If you're looking for perfect indoor bike storage, you have options. This article brings you 10 bike storage ideas for small spaces, ranging from entirely free to affordable to somewhat expensive. You won't find some options applicable because you might not have a pantry or a balcony, or just because you don't feel comfortable drilling a wall in a rented apartment.

The good thing is - we have options for every situation. Hacks and products listed below will make sure your bike doesn't randomly fall in the middle of the night and will keep those free of tyre marks.

Let's dig in!

{{< section-title-green id = "option-1" title = "1. Lean Your Bike on the Wall" >}}

Yup - it's the simplest option that costs nothing.

{{< my-image
    src = "images/1.jpg"
    alt = "Bike learning on a wall"
>}}

Leaning your bike on the wall is a perfectly good way to store a bike in an apartment, especially if you don't have a balcony, pantry, or garage. It will cost you some space, sure, but experiment with a couple of places and you'll surely find the least invasive one.

There will be times when your bike will fall for no apparent reason, usually in the middle of the night. You can also easily leave tire marks on the walls, so keep that in mind:

{{< my-image
    src = "images/2.jpg"
    alt = "Tyre marks on the wall"
>}}

If we had to summarize this option into a couple of pros and cons, here's what that would be:

{{< pro-con 
    pro_1 = "Costs nothing, except for the wall space."
    pro_2 = "No need to lock the bike, since it's in your apartment."
    con_1 = "Bike tends to randomly tip over which can damage the components."
    con_2 = "It's just a matter of time until the wall gets dirty from the tire marks."
    con_3 = "You can easily hit the handlebars while walking past the bike, resulting in the bike falling down."
>}}


{{< section-title-green id = "option-2" title = "2. Store Your Bike on a Balcony" >}}

Provided you have a balcony, you can easily free up your apartment space by storing your bike there.

{{< credited-image
    src = "images/3.jpeg"
    alt = "Bike stored on a balcony"
    page-url = "https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/get-active/2020/everyday-walking-and-cycling/how-to-store-your-bike-indoor-and-outdoor-bike-storage-solutions"
    page-name = "Sustrans"
>}}

Now, this isn't a solution for everyone, and you shouldn't consider it if you live on the ground floor. People had their bikes stolen even while living a couple of floors above the ground. **Never underestimate a thief.**

Also, if you have a small balcony, cramming a bike there won't be the happiest solution. You do get extra space by moving it out from the apartment, and you likely won't hit it by accident every time you walk by it.

If your landlord is okay with it, you can drill a hole in the wall and install a vertical wall mount. That will keep the space around the bike tidy.

{{< pro-con 
    pro_1 = "Doesn't take space in the apartment."
    pro_2 = "You can make the storage solution look extra neat by using vertical wall mounts."
    con_1 = "Your bike could get stolen, especially if you live on a lower floor."
    con_2 = "You'll probably need to lock the bike, which is an additional cost."
    con_3 = "Your bike will likely be exposed to the elements (rain, sun, and so on)."
>}}


{{< section-title-green id = "option-3" title = "3. Lock Your Bike in the Pantry" >}}

Same as with the balcony, this option is only applicable if you have one. If that's the case, it's likely already filled with a bunch of stuff you were too lazy to get rid of. Zero judgment, just speaking from personal experience.

{{< my-image
    src = "images/4.jpg"
    alt = "Bike stored in a pantry"
>}}

We find this option to work well if you're not cycling regularly, and are okay with storing your bike in a potentially dirty and humid area. If you're taking cycling more seriously, you likely want to keep your bike in sight, since it's your pride and joy.

Further, storing your bike in a pantry might be a viable solution if you live on a higher floor in a building without an elevator, and don't want to carry the bike up the stairs. It's all fun and games while carrying a 7kg road bike, but imagine a 25kg e-bike. Thanks, but no thanks.

{{< pro-con 
    pro_1 = "Doesn't take space in the apartment."
    pro_2 = "Ideal if you're not cycling regularly."
    con_1 = "Going in and out of a pantry usually requires multiple sets of keys."
    con_2 = "It can be tricky to get the bike in/out if the pantry space is tight."
    con_3 = "The bike is out of sight, which may worry you from day to day."
>}}


{{< section-title-green id = "option-4" title = "4. Tuck Your Bike Behind a Piece of Furniture" >}}

Another simple and entirely free solution that might work if you have a bigger piece of furniture.

{{< my-image
    src = "images/5.jpg"
    alt = "Bike stored behind a piece of furniture"
>}}

Unlike the balcony and pantry options, this one will work for more people for obvious reasons. It's not the most visually appealing option, but we've seen it work well with a bit of creative thinking.

This option will require you to move the piece of furniture forward, so make sure you have adequate space for that. Road bikes will take less space than mountain bikes due to significantly narrower handlebars. Also, getting the bike in and out this way gets old soon, and you're bound to damage something in the process.

{{< pro-con 
    pro_1 = "Good solution if you have unused space behind the furniture."
    pro_2 = "Can make the living are more personalized, if done correctly."
    con_1 = "If you're storing a mountain bike behind a sofa, it's just a matter of time until you whack your head on the handlebars."
    con_2 = "You can damage the wall and/or furniture if you're not extra careful."
>}}


{{< section-title-green id = "option-5" title = "5. Store Your Bike Under the Stairs" >}}

Just like with the pantry and balcony bike indoor storage options, you'll find this one applicable only if you live in a two-story apartment:

{{< credited-image
    src = "images/6.jpg"
    alt = "Bike stored under the stairs."
    page-url = "https://www.homecrux.com/bike-storage-ideas-tiny-apartment/34738/"
    page-name = "Homecrux"
>}}

Essentially what you do here is place your bike(s) under the stairs. This area is unused most of the time, and you could easily fit a bike there. 

You could go as simple as leaning it on a wall, or as creative as shown in the image above. The perfect middle ground would be to opt for a floor stand, which is covered in the following section.


{{< section-title-green id = "option-6" title = "6. Floor Stand" >}}

This is the option we use for storing a gravel bike and an e-bike in a small room. In particular, we use Rakk mounts available in [standard](https://amzn.to/3r3soaO) and [XL](https://amzn.to/3XzDKiT) formats, depending on your tire width.

{{< my-image
    src = "images/7.jpg"
    alt = "Multiple bikes stored on floor stands"
>}}

Speaking of the standard Rakk mount, it can accommodate tires up to 2.4" wide. The whole mount is heavy (2.7 kg or 6 lbs), so you won't have any issues with stability or accidentally moving the mount while storing the bike. There are some rubberized anti-slip feet at the bottom of the mount, so you can rest assured it will stay where you place it:

{{< affiliate-product-green 
    url = "https://amzn.to/3r3soaO"
    btn_text = "Buy on Amazon"
    img = "images/aff-rakk.jpg"
    title = "Feedback Sports RAKK Bicycle Storage Stand"
    oneliner = "A perfect floor stand for tyres up to 2.4\" wide."
    description = "A floor stand that touches only the tire of your bike, which prevents scratches on expensive components. You can park the bike with front or rear wheels, and you can also combine multiple Rakk mounts if you have more than one bike."
>}}

You can see below how neatly it stores my gravel bike without touching the wall:

{{< my-image
    src = "images/8.jpg"
    alt = "Gravel bike on a Rakk mount"
>}}

If you have a mountain bike, e-bike, or a fat bike, you'll be pleased to know that Rakk mount is also available in XL size, which can accommodate tires between 2.5" and 5.0" wide:

{{< affiliate-product-green 
    url = "https://amzn.to/3XzDKiT"
    btn_text = "Buy on Amazon"
    img = "images/aff-rakk-xl.jpg"
    title = "Feedback Sports Rakk XL Bike Storage Stand"
    oneliner = "A perfect floor stand for tyres between 2.5\" and 5.0\" wide."
    description = "Identical to the regular Rakk, but can accommodate wider tires and fat bikes. Comes with adapter for plus-size tires which you can remove as needed to expand the size of the tray."
>}}

Here's what it looks like when I load my 25 kg (55 lb) e-bike on it:

{{< my-image
    src = "images/9.jpg"
    alt = "E-bike on a Rakk mount"
>}}

Both are sturdy and relatively inexpensive options well suited for indoor bike storage. You can also attach multiple Rakk mounts together, as shown in the following image:

{{< my-image
    src = "images/10.jpg"
    alt = "Connecting multiple Rakk mounts"
>}}

This will provide more stability when storing multiple bikes side by side, provided you have the space for it.

{{< pro-con 
    pro_1 = "Excellent option for securing your bikes."
    pro_2 = "The bike won't tip over randomly and won't leave tire marks on the wall."
    pro_3 = "You can attach multiple Rakk mounts together if you have more than one bike - increased stability."
    con_1 = "Heavier bikes (such as e-bikes) are easier to tip if you hit the handlebars by accident."
>}}


{{< section-title-green id = "option-7" title = "7. Vertical Wall Mounted Hook" >}}

Let's now go over some superb vertical wall mounting options for indoor bike storage. This is exactly how you store bikes in an apartment if space is tight, and you're looking for an aesthetically pleasing solution.

{{< credited-image
    src = "images/11.webp"
    alt = "Bike stored vertically on a wall."
    page-url = "https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/vertical-wall-bike-rack"
    page-name = "Trendhunter"
>}}

Before committing to a vertical wall mount, here are some things you need to consider:
- Are you allowed to drill in your apartment? Check with your landlord first.
- Are there any installations interfacing with your desired mount location? Better safe than sorry.
- Will you be able to actually drill through the wall? 

The last one is tricky if you think about it. We tried drilling the outer building wall but failed to do so with a budget drill. The reason? Exceptionally strong reinforcement bar. Make sure you have a powerful drill first.

Everything okay? Good - let's check the first, and probably the simplest vertical wall mount for apartments:

{{< affiliate-product-green 
    url = "https://amzn.to/46r2Q7K"
    btn_text = "Buy on Amazon"
    img = "images/aff-wallmaster.jpg"
    title = "Wallmaster Bike Rack Garage Wall Mount for Bicycles"
    oneliner = "Free up valuable space in your garage."
    description = "Mount the bike rack securely to the wall, just remember to find the correct height placement before you get started. The mount has rubber-coated hooks that prevent bikes from being scratched or slipping, and can take up to 22.5 kg (50 lbs) in hanging weight."
>}}

It's a dirt cheap option that requires only four screws and will allow your bike to hang securely from the wall. It has a weight limit of up to 22.5 kg or 50 lbs, which should suit anything but the heaviest of e-bikes.

If you want an even more minimalistic vertical wall mount for storing bikes in an apartment, take a look at this one by Delta Mount:

{{< affiliate-product-green 
    url = "https://amzn.to/3XuvIaQ"
    btn_text = "Buy on Amazon"
    img = "images/aff-deltamount.jpg"
    title = "Delta Cycle Leonardo Bike Rack Mount Storage"
    oneliner = "An elegant product design with premium powdercoated finish."
    description = "Free up your floor space and protect your bicycle with Delta Cycle’s Leonardo Bike Wall Mount Rack. This rack saves space by storing your bikes vertically against the wall and features a clever hook-shaped design for easy access and bike removal. Ideal for your apartment, home, or garage. Built to accommodate any bike size or type, this bike hanger supports a single bike up to 18kg (40lbs) with tires measuring under 2.5\"."
>}}

This mounting system is as configurable as they come. You can order from 1 up to 4 pack bike hooks, with an additional option of fitting fat bike tires.

Now that you know your options for affordable vertical wall mounts, let's go over some general pros and cons:

{{< pro-con 
    pro_1 = "Aesthetically pleasing solution but also takes the least amount of space."
    pro_2 = "Simple to get your bike in/out of the mount."
    con_1 = "Requires drilling, which might turn down some people, and perhaps isn't allowed if you live in a rented apartment."
    con_2 = "You can leave tire marks on your wall if you're not careful."
>}}


{{< section-title-green id = "option-8" title = "8. Horizontal Wall Hanger" >}}

When it comes to horizontal bike wall mounts for storing your bike in an apartment, things get crazy expensive. The products are superb, but the high asking price is difficult to justify when there are so many affordable options.

{{< credited-image
    src = "images/12.webp"
    alt = "Bike hanging from a horizontal wall mount."
    page-url = "https://dahanger.co/products/dahanger"
    page-name = "Dahanger"
>}}

The first one on our list isn't only for storing your bike, but also all of the gear you take on your ride, such as a helmet, gloves, and so on. It's molded, filed with HD foam, flame-polished, and made in the USA, unlike most of the other alternatives:

{{< affiliate-product-green 
    url = "https://dahanger.co/products/dahanger"
    btn_text = "Buy on Dahanger.co"
    img = "images/12.webp"
    title = "DAHÄNGER"
    oneliner = "Modern indoor bike rack that looks great with or without a bike."
    description = "Combining sleek design with perfect function. Available in grey or black. Includes all the hardware and a black felt pad for added protection. No more scratched frames or kinked cables by hanging your bike by the seat. Designed for lighter bikes weighing up to 13.5 kg (30 lbs)."
>}}

The Dahanger promises to keep your frame scratch-free because the bike is hung by the saddle. Even though it looks sturdy, it can only support bikes weighing up to 13.5 kg (30 lbs), so most mountain bikes won't make the cut. Even if they do, you're bound to leave tire marks on your wall due to the handlebar width. Go with this one if you can afford it and if you ride a bike with narrow handlebars.

The next option on our list is even more expensive but can accommodate a bit wider handlebars (up to 66cm, or 26"). It can accommodate bikes weighing up to 20kg or 44lbs, which covers pretty much all road and gravel bikes:

{{< affiliate-product-green 
    url = "https://en.parax.de/en/products/d-rack"
    btn_text = "Buy on Parax.de"
    img = "images/aff-parax-d-rack.png"
    title = "Parax D-RACK"
    oneliner = "The design bike wall mount"
    description = "Elaborately milled anodized aluminum, durable silicone to protect your bike frame, and precious Kebony or olive wood make the bike mount a real gem in your home. Thanks to the intelligent drilling template and the mounting material supplied, the wall bracket can be installed in no time at all. The ingenious thing: Even bicycles with a sloping top tube can be hung up straight."
>}}

You and you alone should be the ultimate judge of whether a horizontal wall bike mount is a worthy indoor bike storage solution. Here's what we think:

{{< pro-con 
    pro_1 = "Modern, minimalistic, and visually attractive bike storage solution."
    pro_2 = "Can store more than the bike itself - helmet, gloves, shoes, and everything you need for your ride."
    con_1 = "Crazy expensive."
    con_2 = "Can only store one bike per unit, which drives the price even higher if you have multiple bikes."
    con_3 = "Because of a specific design, you likely won't be able to fit a wide bar mountain bike, or you'll risk leaving tire marks on the wall."
>}}


{{< section-title-green id = "option-9" title = "9. Bike Stacker" >}}

You should consider this option only if you want to store multiple bikes in your apartment. A bike stacker storage solution allows you to vertically stack two bikes, and essentially halve the amount of storage space needed. 

{{< credited-image
    src = "images/13.jpeg"
    alt = "Bikes mounted on a vertical bike stacker."
    page-url = "https://www.etrailer.com/Bike-Storage/Thule/THBSTK2.html"
    page-name = "Etrailer"
>}}

The first option we recommend comes from one of the most reputable brands - Thule. It's made from heavy-duty steel is 213cm tall (84") and can carry up to two bikes. The recommended combined bike weight is 32 kg (70.5 lbs), which is somewhat on the lower end:

{{< affiliate-product-green 
    url = "https://amzn.to/3r39wst"
    btn_text = "Buy on Amazon"
    img = "images/aff-bike-stacker-1.jpg"
    title = "Thule Bike Stacker Storage Unit"
    oneliner = "Free standing storage bike rack for your home."
    description = "The Thule BSTK2 Bike Stacker is a convenient upright, freestanding bicycle storage rack solution designed for use when wall or ceiling-based storage is not a viable option. The rack holds two bicycles of virtually any weight, which it accommodates through a combination of heavy-duty steel construction and independently adjustable arms that can be moved up or down the length of the unit."
>}}

Also, it's worth noting that you might have trouble storing a full suspension bike on this mount, depending on where the rear shock is located. Take a look at the [reviews](https://www.thule.com/en-us/bike-rack/accessories/thule-bike-stacker-_-578101) and you'll see what we're talking about.

If you're in the market for a cheaper alternative, this one by Delta Cycle checks a lot of boxes:

{{< affiliate-product-green 
    url = "https://amzn.to/43Xz4WD"
    btn_text = "Buy on Amazon"
    img = "images/aff-bike-stacker-2.jpg"
    title = "Delta Cycle 2 Bike Rack Storage"
    oneliner = "Fully Adjustable Garage Bike Rack for Road, MTB, and Hybrid Bicycles."
    description = "Safely suspends your bicycles with no permanent mounting or drilling required. Our innovative wall-lean design can securely hold up to 36 kg (80 lbs). The rack’s super small footprint saves space by storing your bikes vertically. Ideal for an apartment, home, or garage."
>}}

It's about three times cheaper, but can somehow hold more weight (up to 36kg or 80lbs). It still won't hold a 25kg e-bike, but hey, almost nothing will.

As with the previous option by Thule, this mount will also have trouble holding full suspension bikes (depending on the shock location) and bikes with step-through frames.

{{< pro-con 
    pro_1 = "Ideal if you have two bikes and don't mind the added vertical space."
    pro_2 = "Essentially takes as much space as a single floor mount."
    con_1 = "A bit more on the pricier side."
    con_2 = "Can have trouble holding a full suspension mountain bike, and definitely won't accommodate bikes with step-through frames."
    con_3 = "Over 2 meters (78\") in height, which might be too much for some spaces."
>}}


{{< section-title-green id = "option-10" title = "10. Hang Your Bike From the Ceiling" >}}

If you don't have the floor space to store your bike(s) and are looking for an affordable ceiling-mounted option, this is the section for you.

{{< credited-image
    src = "images/14.jpg"
    alt = "Bike hanging from the ceiling."
    page-url = "https://www.amazon.com/2005-Cycle-Products-Bike-Hoist/dp/B000PEURIQ?&linkCode=sl1&tag=radecicdario-20&linkId=706ebfaab81a4d9ec497bc363984c027&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl"
    page-name = "Amazon"
>}}

The first option comes from Bike Hoists and provides secure ceiling bike storage. You can hang a bike that weighs up to 45 kg (100 lbs), which is pretty much any bike you can imagine. Just make sure your ceiling is high enough, so you don't hit your head by accident when walking by:

{{< affiliate-product-green 
    url = "https://amzn.to/3JAuwNE"
    btn_text = "Buy on Amazon"
    img = "images/aff-ceiling-1.jpg"
    title = "Bike Hoists Overhead Pulley System"
    oneliner = "Secure ceiling bike storage with 45 kg (100 lb) capacity."
    description = "Allows you to lift heavy products, up to 45 kg (100 lb) capacity. For indoor ceilings up to 366cm (12ft). high. Once the bike is out of the way you free up so much floor space you won't know what to do with it all. Safe locking mechanism prevents accidental release."
>}}

The pulley system is something to get used to, but the product has excellent reviews. There's even an option to order 2-pack/4-pack, depending on how many bikes you have.

The following option is about 10 times more expensive, but allows you to store up to four bikes, each weighing up to 22 kg (50 lbs). This should be enough for everything except the heaviest of e-bikes.

{{< affiliate-product-green 
    url = "https://amzn.to/44oNOO1"
    btn_text = "Buy on Amazon"
    img = "images/aff-ceiling-2.jpg"
    title = "Saris Bike Storage Ceiling Rack"
    oneliner = "A go-to solution for storing multiple bikes on a ceiling."
    description = "Effortlessly store up to four bikes within arm's reach. Free up floor space in your garage or basement (22 kg or 50 lbs per bike). Wheel hooks adjust to the bicycle's wheelbase to accommodate a wide range of bicycle sizes. Accommodates bicycles with wheelbases up to 56\", and can be used with bike tire widths up to 2.5\"."
>}}

Although more expensive, it's easier to attach/detach your bikes since you're not dealing with a pulley system. Definitely an option to consider, provided you have enough vertical space.

{{< pro-con 
    pro_1 = "Ideal if you absolutely need to free up the floor space."
    pro_2 = "Typically supports more weight than bike stackers and horizontal wall mounts."
    con_1 = "More suited for garages than apartments."
    con_2 = "Requires a lot of vertical space if you want to be able to walk below the bikes."
    con_3 = "Can be more expensive when compared to other alternatives"
>}}

## How to Store Bikes in an Apartment - Summary
To conclude - you have many options to choose from if you're investigating bike storage ideas for small spaces. There's no clear winner here, as everything depends on your individual conditions.

Maybe you have a pantry, balcony, or garage - this changes everything, and your preferred bike indoor storage system won't apply to the others.

You can go as simple as leaning the bike on the wall, but we recommend getting a decent floor mount at a minimum. This will prevent your bike from tipping over randomly in the middle of the night and will make sure the walls don't get dirty over time.
